					Donald Trump impeached
				</h1>

				President Donald Trump's July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine was at the center of a whistleblower scandal that led to him becoming the third president in US history to be impeached. According to a transcript of the call released by the White House, Trump repeatedly pushed for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a former vice president and potential 2020 political rival. He also asked Ukraine to investigate Biden's son, Hunter.
